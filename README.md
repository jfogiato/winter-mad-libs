## Instructions
- Clone down this repo 
- Plan out and write CSS to design the application. No comps are provided, be as creative as you want! The HTML has been written for you, but add more HTML elements, classes, etc. or change the structure around if needed.  
- Create the following functionality: 

_As a user, I should be able to type a word into each text box. If I have filled out all boxes, and clicked the button, I should see:_
  - _the text boxes disappear._
  - _a story appear with my words filled in the correct places._

### Consideration
- How will you handle a user submitting before they have filled out the text boxes?

### Bonus Ideas
- Add the ability to "save" stories
- Add another story template and allow the user to choose 
- Provide the option for a user to have a word filled in at random instead of typing it in
- Choose your own!
